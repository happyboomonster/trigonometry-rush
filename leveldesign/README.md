This folder is for level...stuff.

Designs stored in cryptic formats or lists are placed in "Levels".
Output is a folder that holds the output from your latest conversion
in list format.

Convert***.py/.pyc files:  ConvertLib.py & ConvertLib.pyc is
a converter library.  Don't use this library directly.  Instead, use
the ConvertEngine.py file.  Place your design in list format at the top
of the file with the name "level".  Run the script, and your converted
output will be in the "Output" folder.  You can copy and paste that into
../GDtst.py and try out your level!
