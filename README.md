Hi.  Thanks for checking out the README.  Hopefully it's helpful...
To try out my take on Reverse-Engineering Geometry Dash [is it reverse
engineering?  I'm not sure... =) ], run GDtst.py in Python 2 or 3!
(both should work fine, although I don't actively use Python 3 so there
 might be some bugs...)

Creating Levels:
Please refer to the README in the "leveldesign" folder.  Also, you can
contact me on my Github account ("happyboomonster").

Program Structure:
Basically, I made a few classes.  One for the Cube sprite, including position,
cube frames, rotation and a few other things.  Then I made a class for
A) The Bricks in the level B) The spikes and other inanimate things that
hurt you C) The "bounceballs" (I can't think of a better name) D) The
BouncePads E) The Portals...  Then I made a Menu and GameLoop class to link
all the stuff I made together.

What I want to add:  Changeable cube costumes, and a menu for that
A front menu [WHAT, I know...  I don't have a front menu yet  =(  ]
Controller and custom control setup support
Optomisations that speed up my horrible code!  =)
Make it easier for people to make levels
